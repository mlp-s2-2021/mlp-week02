Mathematically, we describe this as these columns are linearly depenedent, which implies that our model matrix is *rank deficient*. You can check this explicitly by via the `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank` function which will report that `X` (and $\\boldsymbol{X}^\\top\\boldsymbol{X}$) are of rank 3 not 4 which is what we might have naievely expected.\n",
